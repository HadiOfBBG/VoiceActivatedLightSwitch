# VoiceActivatedLightSwitch
A voice activated light switch built using Raspberry Pi and wit.ai.


My wit.ai instance which I have trained is private. Because I run the program on my Raspberry Pi 24*7, the instance would grab all the regular conversation in my house as well. I do not wish to expose that to the public.

I will check in more instructions and code as soon as I finish cleaning it up.
