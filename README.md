# VoiceActivatedLightSwitch
A voice activated light switch built using Raspberry Pi and wit.ai.

My wit.ai instance which I have trained is private. Because I run the program on my Raspberry Pi 24*7, the instance would grab all the regular conversation in my house as well. I do not wish to expose that to the public. You can create your own wit.ai instance for free and train it if you are interested.

I have shared the client program that runs on my Raspberry Pi. 

I will check in more instructions, schematic and code as soon as I finish cleaning it up.

More explanation is available on my website : http://arunpn.com/voiceActivatedLightSwitch.html
